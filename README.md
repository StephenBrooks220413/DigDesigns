# DigDesigns
asp.Net core (MVC) app
Must have visual studio community, or professional to effectively edit and debug the app. 
I went through NuGet Package Manager and installed Bower, and BunlerMinifier for html, css and javascript files.
If any question you may email me @ stephen.brooks220413@gmail.com
